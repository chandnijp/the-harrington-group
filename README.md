Cloning the Repository

First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
cd: to change your working directory.
cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.

Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
git clone https://github.com/betteridiot/b575f19

Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory:
cd b575f19/
ls -la
